                Welcome to my profile page. This page is dedicated to my work and experience with Software and WebApp Development.
                I got my start on October 15th, 2015 when the company I was working for took a chance on me.
                I worked 10 hour days for months trying to learn how to program. I was blessed because I was getting paid to learn but
                I also had work I needed to do so it forced me to learn quickly.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                I realized quickly I had found something I really enjoyed and wanted to learn as much as I could.
                I had found other things in life i enjoyed but I never really felt like it was something I would want to do for a living.
            </p><br />
            <p>My goal with this page is to help you learn who I am and how committed I am to everything in my life.</p>
